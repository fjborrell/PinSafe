# UberSafe
McHacks9 Hackathon - Javascript/React Native Mobile App Project (Home Screen UI Implementation)

https://devpost.com/software/ubersafe



*Note: The inspiration of the project name stems from the defintion of the word "Uber: Denoting an outstanding or supreme example of a particular kind of person or thing". The idea of the app is that it keeps you "uber" safe. This project is not in any way affiliated with Uber Inc. and was created solely to participate in the McHacks9 Hackathon*
