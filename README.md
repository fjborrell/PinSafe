# PinSafe

McHacks9 Hackathon - Javascript/React Native Mobile App Project (Home Screen UI Implementation)

# Hackathon Submission & Description

https://devpost.com/software/ubersafe

## Inspiration

People don't always feel safe walking home at night or in unfamiliar places! We wanted to make an application that could help you avoid those situations overall, and contact anyone quickly if need be.

## What it does

The goal of the app is to be able to drop pins on a map about hazards or unsafe locations, and calculate safe routes via the crowd-sourced pins. You can also call emergency contacts during a trip, and have friends and family track a trip if you wish. Since our team was learning the mobile tech stack from scratch, we only implemented a Home Screen prototype, but designed the look/feel of the other features.

## How we built it

We built the our project as a mobile app using Javascript and the React Native framework. Testing was done via Expo.io, and coding was completed in Visual Studio Code.

## Challenges we ran into

Nobody on the team had done mobile development before so we learned Javascript and ReactNative from scratch. This led to a lot of bugs throughout the development and the scope of our physical prototype was narrowed over time. We also had to learn about the mobile dev environment from scratch, including simulating an app on the computer and live-updating it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We designed the idea of an app meant to protect people and make people feel safe! We also learned a whole new tech stack and development environment from scratch and created a working home screen UI implementation in just one day!

## What we learned

We learned the foundations of mobile development, app simulation, and all about frameworks! Specifically, Javascript, React Native, iOS Simulation, Expo.io. We also learned some Redux and TailwindCSS basics (which both did not end up being implemented in our final product).

## What's next for PinSafe

To implement a functional map API (e.g. google maps) and develop the ability to crowd-source safety information!

## NOTE:

This project was created solely for the purpose of participating in McHacks9 Hackathon and has not been used for any other purpose.
